## My Scientific Projects
This repository contains my scientific projects that can be used in Physics classrooms. Most of the projects are related to BBC Micro:bit that I program in MicroPython. Some of the project folders contain pure *Python* files and *.ipynb files* besides the *MicroPython* files. I also use the *Pandas*, *Numpy* and *Matplotlib* packeges in the Jupiter Notebooks. 

In the projects *Measuring Planck constant* I use the Micro:bit to determine the value of the *Planck constant* with the help of the LED attached to the board. The Micro:bit is both the power source that varies the voltage on a fine scale and the measuring device that gets and process the data from the circuit. You can find the detailed description in the README of the project.  

The project *Getting Accelerometer Data in Real Time* focuses on streamimng data from a Micro:bit attached to a moving object to another one attached to a computer. The moving Micro:bit collects data from its accelerometer, and the data is streamed and collected by the other one. Then the data is written into a *csv* file that is analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook. Details and results can be found in the README file.

I am working on 2 more projects. One is the extension of the secondly mentioned project, in which I try achive to teach a *supervised learning ML algorithm* to distinguish simple harmonic motion from pendulum and circular motions done by a BBC Micro:bit. The second project is the application of an *unsupervised ML algorithm* in relation to the Herzsprung-Russel Diagram.
