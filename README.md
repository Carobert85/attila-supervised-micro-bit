# Microbit-projects
This repository contains my projects carried out with BBC Micro:bit that can be used in Physics classrooms.

In these projects I focus on the sensors the single board computer is equipped with, and Micro:bit collects and analyses the data coming from the sensors.
The collected data can be processed directly by the device or can be exported into Excel or into a file created by me.
