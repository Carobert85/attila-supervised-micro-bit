## My Scientific Projects
This repository contains my scientific projects that can be used in Physics classrooms. Most of the projects are related to BBC Micro:bit that I program in MicroPython. Some of the project folders contain pure *Python* files and *.ipynb files* besides the *MicroPython* files. I also use the *Pandas*, *Numpy* and *Matplotlib* packeges in the Jupiter Notebooks. 

In the projects *Measuring Planck constant* I use the Micro:bit to determine the value of the *Planck constant* with the help of the LED attached to the board. The Micro:bit is both the power source that varies the voltage on a fine scale and the measuring device that gets and process the data from the circuit. You can find the detailed description in the README of the project.  

In most of the projects I focus on the sensors the single board computer is equipped with, and Micro:bit collects and analyses the data coming from the sensors.
The collected data can be processed directly by the device or can be exported into an Excel speadsheet.
