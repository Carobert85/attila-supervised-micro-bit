# Microbit-projects
This repository contains my projects carried out with BBC Micro:bit that can be used in Physics classrooms.

In one of the projects I use the Micro:bit to determine the value of the Planck constant with the help of the LED attached to the board. The Micro:bit is both the power source that varies the voltage on a fine scale and the measuring device that gets and process the data from the circuit. You can find the detailed description in the README of the project.  

In most of the projects I focus on the sensors the single board computer is equipped with, and Micro:bit collects and analyses the data coming from the sensors.
The collected data can be processed directly by the device or can be exported into an Excel speadsheet.
