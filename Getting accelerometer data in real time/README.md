# Getting and visualizing the accelerometer's data in real time

The most exciting application of an accelerometer is to observe a moving object in real time and to collect numerical data of its motion. Unfortunately, the Micro:bit does not have an internal permanent memory where the gained data could be stored. However, there are some simple solutions to gain the data collected by Micro:bit and to store it. One of them is the Excel Data Streamer. Data Streamer is a freely downloadable application for Microsoft Excel that enables the user to read out data from a sensor through a microcontroller or send out data to an actuator in real time. BBC Micro:bit is also suitable for helping data transfer from a sensor to the Excel worksheet making it possible to visualize and analyse the gathered data. One of the Micro:bitâ€™s advantage is that we can collect data from the inbuilt sensors, in my example from the accelerometer.

I observed the motion of a long (l = 2.36 m) pendulum with Micro:bit and Data Streamer. I attached the board computer to the top of the moving object and programmed it to measure and stream via radio the value of a<sub>z</sub> during the time of the observation. The streamed data was captured by a receiver Micro:bit which sent it to the Excel. (Figure 1.) The programs for both devices can be investigated in this repo (*transmitter.py*, *reciever.py*) and a portion of the results in Figure 2.

Another version to visualizing the captured data is to use the Mu code editor. The second Micro:bit is connected to the computer whilst running the Mu code editor. As long as the program 'receiver.py' runs on the Micro:bit, receives the data from the first one and transfers it towards the editor. We can use the REPL and Plotter functions of the MU editor to show the change of acceleration over time.

An advanced version of data storage and analysis is to write the data captured by the second Micro:bit to a *csv file*. To achieve this, I wrote a program called *PC.py*. This program is run in the PC's terminal, shows the captured data and writes it to the file. To investigate the data deeper, I designed a Jupyter Notebook to have an insight of the dataset and to visualize the captured data. I used the *Pandas* and the *Matplotlib* packages in that notebook.

I share some examples of the graphs made in the notebook here.
