# Measuring The Planck constant with an LED and Micro:bit

If we want to measure the Planck constant in the classroom the use of LEDs seems to be obvious. Lot of descriptions are available in this matter, I choose the article found in the link below: \
(https://www.scienceinschool.org/2014/issue28/planck) \
The crucial steps are: measuring and determining the threshold or activation voltage (V_a) for LEDs with different colours, finding out or measuring the wavelength of the emitted light, plotting the graph Va against 1/$lambda$ and working out the gradient of the straight line of best fit (m) to calculate the Planck constant with the help of the following equation:
$$
h = frac{em}{c}
$$
