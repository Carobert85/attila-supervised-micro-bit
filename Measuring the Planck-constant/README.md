# Measuring The Planck constant with an LED and Micro:bit

If we want to measure the Planck constant in the classroom the use of LEDs seems to be obvious. Lot of descriptions are available in this matter, I choose the article found in the link below: \
https://www.scienceinschool.org/2014/issue28/planck \
The crucial steps are: measuring and determining the threshold or activation voltage V<sub>a</sub> for LEDs with different colours, finding out or measuring the wavelength of the emitted light, plotting the graph V<sub>a</sub> against &lambda; and working out the gradient of the straight line of best fit (m) to calculate the Planck constant with the help of the following equation:\
h = em/c \
This method is useful and accurate enough but needs more time to carry out. I developed another method using Micro:bit to make the measurement faster so it can be used as a class demonstration, too. The arrangement of the experiment can be seen in Figure 1.
