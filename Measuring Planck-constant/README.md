If we want to measure the Planck constant in the classroom the use of LEDs seems to be obvious. Lot of descriptions are available in this matter, I choose the article found in [8]. The crucial steps are: measuring and determining the threshold or activation voltage (Va) for LEDs with different colours, finding out or measuring the wavelength of the emitted light, plotting the graph Va against 1/ÔÅ¨ and working out the gradient of the straight line of best fit (m) to calculate the Planck constant with the help of the following equation:
Type equation here.
h = em/c.
This method is useful and accurate enough but needs more time to carry out. I developed an other method using Micro:bit to make the measurement faster so it can be used as a class demonstration, too. The arrangement of the experiment can be seen in Figure 5.
